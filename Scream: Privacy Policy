Hello, welcome to the privacy policy for Scream!

Scream is an android app developed by Anna Liu that is available on Google Play. This app is a voice-interactive game that 
encourages the use of screaming to relieve stress.

I respect the privacy of users very much. The app does not retrieve nor store any personal information about the user.
The only data that the app stores are voice recordings taken with the user's permission, which are locally 
stored in external storage solely on the user's device. These recordings are removed every time the user presses 
the "Finish" button or the user finishes screaming.

If the app causes any concerning breach of security, feel free to contact me through email, and I can fix the 
issue(s).
